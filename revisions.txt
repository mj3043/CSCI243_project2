CSCI 243 - Project 2: Postfix Interpreter
Author: mj3043
Date: November 23, 2025

FINAL SUBMISSION - FULLY WORKING

All required features implemented correctly and tested extensively:

- Correct tokenization with proper memory ownership using strdup
- Recursive-descent parsing of postfix expressions
- Full support for +, -, *, /, %, = (assignment), and ? (ternary operator)
- Assignment operator properly treats left operand as l-value (not evaluated)
- Ternary operator correctly builds ALT_OP and Q_OP nodes and evaluates only one branch
- Fully parenthesized infix output with no extra spaces
- Symbol table loading from optional file (sym.1 format)
- Symbol table correctly displayed at start and end with exact formatting
- Variables can be created and modified during evaluation
- Chained assignments work (e.g., a b c 42 = = =)
- Robust error handling for all cases (too few/many tokens, illegal token, div by zero, undefined symbol, etc.)
- All memory dynamically allocated and properly freed
- No memory leaks — valgrind clean on all test cases
- Proper handling of comments (# at start or middle of line)
- Input line length checking and graceful handling of over-long lines
- Strict C99 compliance with -Wall -Wextra -pedantic (zero warnings on final build)

Development used Git regularly throughout the project.
All bugs related to string ownership, pop-before-copy, and POSIX feature macros were identified and fixed.

Program passes all manual tests including:
  a → a = 10
  a 5 + → (a+5) = 15
  1 2 3 ? → (1?(2:3)) = 2
  foo 999 = → (foo=999) = 999
  foo foo 111 + = → (foo=(foo+111)) = 1110

Ready for Gradescope autograder.
This is the final, correct, fully functional version.
